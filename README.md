## General info
Add more general information about project. What the purpose of the project is? Motivation?
This project was created to serve the purpose of testing a set of API end points that were key to the functioning of a Mobile Application built on both Android and iOS platforms. 
A thorough regression suite had to be developed for all the APIs that were significant for the App and needs to be run on a daily basis not only to check the sanity of API end-points 
but also to ensure the functioning of the backend systems, hence the Automation Suite had to be designed and developed for CI/CD compatability.
